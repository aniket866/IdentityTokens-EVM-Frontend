* Run prettier --write

If commit fails, fix errors before retrying.

---

# 🚀 4️⃣ Development Commands

## ▶️ Start Development Server

```
npm run dev
```

App runs locally (usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).

---

## 🏗 Build Project

```
npm run build
```

---

## 🚀 Start Production Server

```
npm run start
```

Build must succeed before PR.

---

# 🧹 5️⃣ Linting & Formatting (MANDATORY)

Before committing:

## 🔍 Run ESLint

```
npm run lint
```

## ✨ Format Code

```
npm run format
```

## ✅ Check Formatting

```
npm run check-format
```

PRs failing lint/format checks may be rejected.

# 🎨 Frontend Standards

## 🧱 Architecture Rules

* Use App Router properly (Next.js 16).
* Keep components small and reusable.
* Separate UI and Web3 logic.
* Use custom hooks for contract interactions.
* Avoid deeply nested components.

---

## 🔗 Web3 Integration Rules

Stack includes:

* Wagmi
* Viem
* RainbowKit
* MetaMask SDK
* WalletConnect
* React Query

Ensure:

* Wallet errors are handled.
* Loading states exist.
* Transactions show feedback.
* No private keys are exposed.

Test wallet connection manually before PR.

---

## 🎨 Styling Rules

* Use TailwindCSS v4.
* Avoid inline styles.
* Use tailwind-merge when combining classes.
* Maintain responsive design.
* Keep animations clean (Framer Motion).

---

#  7️⃣ Commit Properly

```
git add .
git commit -m "feat: short clear description"
```

Examples:

* feat: add rainbowkit wallet modal
* fix: resolve layout shift issue
* refactor: move web3 logic to hooks
* style: improve button hover states

Avoid vague messages like "update".

---
